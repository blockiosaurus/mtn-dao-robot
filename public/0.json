    "description": "Forged in the neon-lit workshops of New Silicon Valley, Thunder Lance emerged as the champion of the Robotic Combat League's jousting division. Originally designed as a maintenance bot for high-voltage power lines, this 800-pound titan found its true calling in the arena. With lightning-quick reflexes powered by quantum processors and a lance crafted from recycled spacecraft titanium, Thunder Lance dominates the field with a perfect blend of medieval valor and cutting-edge technology. Its signature move? The 'Static Shock Strike' - a masterful thrust that crackles with electromagnetic energy.",
